# Cost Optimization Challenge: Managing Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture

## Current Architecture and Problem Statement

### Current Architecture:
We are currently using a **serverless infrastructure** in **Azure** where billing records are stored in **Azure Cosmos DB**. Each record can be as large as **300 KB**, and the total number of records has grown to over **2 million**.

- **Azure Cosmos DB** is used to store all billing data.
- The database is partitioned using appropriate keys to ensure efficient data access.
- Billing records are frequently accessed within **90 days** of creation, but records older than **90 days** are rarely accessed.

### Problem Statement:
The system is facing the following challenges:
1. **Higher Costs**: Storing over 2 million records in **Azure Cosmos DB** results in increased costs due to the large amount of data stored, as well as high request and transaction charges.
2. **Access Latency for Older Records**: Records older than 90 days are seldom accessed but still need to be available quickly when requested. The current system is not optimized for cold or infrequent access, which leads to high operational costs.
3. **Data Growth**: As the volume of data increases, managing cost and performance becomes increasingly challenging.
4. **No Downtime**: The system needs to be optimized without introducing downtime or requiring changes to the existing API that reads and writes data.

## Solution Requirements

To address the challenges, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Cost Optimization**: Find a way to optimize costs without sacrificing performance for frequently accessed data (under 90 days).
2. **Low Latency for Older Data**: Ensure that older records (over 90 days) can still be retrieved in a timely manner, even though they are archived.
3. **No API Changes**: Ensure that no changes are required to the existing **read/write API** for billing records. The API should continue to function as-is.
4. **Scalability**: The solution must scale as the volume of data grows, ensuring that it remains cost-effective and performant even with millions of records.
5. **Zero Downtime**: The solution must be implemented in a way that guarantees **no downtime** and **no data loss** during migration.
6. **Maintainability**: The solution should be easy to implement, automate, and maintain over time.

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Solution:
The solution involves a **two-tier data storage architecture** where active records (those less than 90 days old) remain in **Azure Cosmos DB**, and records older than 90 days are archived to **Azure Blob Storage** using **cost-effective storage tiers** like **Cool** or **Archive**.

1. **Data Storage Architecture**:
   - **Active Data in Cosmos DB**: Keep records that are frequently accessed (within 90 days) in **Azure Cosmos DB**. This will ensure fast access for recent records.
   - **Archived Data in Blob Storage**: Move records older than 90 days to **Azure Blob Storage**. Use **Blob Storage â€“ Cool** or **Archive** tier to minimize costs. Archive data will be retrieved from Blob Storage only when requested.
   
2. **Data Retrieval Strategy**:
   - **Proxy Layer (Azure Function)**: Introduce a **proxy layer** (using **Azure Functions**) that handles the retrieval process. When a record is requested:
     - The function first checks **Cosmos DB**.
     - If not found in Cosmos DB, the function will query **Blob Storage** to retrieve the record.
   - **Decompression and Parsing**: For efficient storage, data in Blob Storage will be stored in compressed (gzip) format. The proxy layer will decompress the data before returning it to the user.

3. **Data Migration Strategy**:
   - Implement an **Azure Function** that periodically moves records older than 90 days from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage.
   - Once a record is successfully archived to Blob Storage, it will be deleted from Cosmos DB to free up resources.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Use **Azure Monitor** and **Blob Storage** to log migration activities, data access, and potential failures.
   - Maintain logs of successful migrations and potential errors, enabling easy auditing and rollback if needed.

5. **Automation**:
   - Schedule data migration to run periodically (e.g., every night) using **Azure Functions**.
   - Automate the entire process using **Azure Logic Apps** or **Azure Functions** for migration, and **Azure Monitor** for logging and error tracking.

## ðŸ’° Storage Cost Comparison

| Storage Type            | Price per GB/Month (approx.) | Usage Scenario              | Est. Monthly Cost (1 TB) |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Azure Cosmos DB**     | ~$0.25 per GB                | Active records (< 90 days)  | ~$256                    |
| **Blob Storage (Hot)**  | ~$0.0184 per GB              | Frequently accessed archive | ~$18.40                  |
| **Blob Storage (Cool)** | ~$0.01 per GB                | Infrequently accessed data  | ~$10.00                  |
| **Table Storage**       | ~$0.06 per GB                | Metadata & indexing         | ~$6.00                   |

> **Result**: Moving 80% of data (~800 GB) from Cosmos DB to Blob/Cool reduces monthly storage cost from **$204 â†’ ~$8â€“15**, saving **~90â€“95%**.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:
1. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Moving older records to **Blob Storage Archive** significantly reduces storage costs.
   - Using **Cool** and **Archive** tiers in Blob Storage is much cheaper than retaining all records in Cosmos DB.
   
2. **Scalable**:
   - The solution scales well as data grows. The cost structure of Blob Storage allows you to scale with minimal incremental cost.
   
3. **Zero Downtime**:
   - The solution can be implemented with zero downtime by using **Azure Functions** to migrate data in small batches.
   - Since the **read/write API** does not change, the application will experience no interruptions during migration.

4. **No API Changes**:
   - The existing **read/write API** will remain unchanged, ensuring there is no impact on the business logic and user experience.

5. **Automation and Maintainability**:
   - The use of **Azure Functions** and **Logic Apps** ensures the solution is fully automated, requiring minimal manual intervention once set up.
   - **Logging** and **monitoring** via **Azure Monitor** makes it easy to maintain and troubleshoot the system.

### Cons:
1. **Increased Latency for Archived Data**:
   - Data retrieval from **Blob Storage** may introduce some additional latency, especially if data needs to be decompressed.
   - While **Cool** and **Archive** tiers are cost-effective, retrieval times from these tiers are slower than from **Cosmos DB**.

2. **Complexity in Data Migration**:
   - Migrating large datasets from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage may be resource-intensive and could result in initial performance overhead during the migration phase.
   - Ensuring data consistency during migration and rollback can add complexity to the solution.

3. **Potential for Missing Data**:
   - There is a risk of missing data if migration fails or is interrupted. Proper error handling and logging must be in place to mitigate this.

4. **Decompression Overhead**:
   - Storing data in compressed format in Blob Storage means there is additional overhead for decompressing the data when itâ€™s accessed, which could increase retrieval time, especially for large records.

This solution optimizes for cost while maintaining performance and scalability, using a **serverless architecture** with minimal operational overhead and ensuring high availability of all data without requiring downtime.
